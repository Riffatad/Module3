# Module3: Machine Learning Fundamentals 
## Task:
Implement a basic machine learning model (e.g., linear regression or 
classification) using scikit-learn. 
Applied a basic machine learning model to train and test and predict IRIS data.
## Assignment: 
Used Logistic Regression Model to train, test and predict the arrtibutes of flowers in the IRIS dataset based on the criteria Sepal and Petal measurement.
Model evaluated the data and generated the accuracy,precision, recall and F1-score(Confusion Matrix)
Based on the Confusion Matrix we plotted Heatmap
